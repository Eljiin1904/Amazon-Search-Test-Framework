                                                       Amazon Search .JS test Framework


Step 1: Create a new directory for your project

mkdir amazon-search-test-framework

cd amazon-search-test-framework


Step 2: Initialize Your Project
Initialize your project with npm to create a package.json file:


npm init -y


This command generates a package.json file with default values.


Step 3: Install Dependencies
Install the necessary dependencies for your project:


npm install selenium-webdriver@latest mocha@latest mocha-allure-reporter@latest allure-commandline@latest


selenium-webdriver: For interacting with web elements and automating browser actions.

mocha: Testing framework for structuring and running your tests.

mocha-allure-reporter: A reporter for Mocha that generates Allure reports.

allure-commandline: Command-line tool for generating and viewing Allure reports


Step 4: Project Structure
Create a directory structure for your test framework. Here's a recommended structure:


project-folder/

│

├── package.json

├── package-lock.json

├── test/

│   ├── amazon_search_test.js

│

├── lib/

│   ├── webdriver-helpers.js


├── allure-results/
    ├── allure-results files.js

├── allure-report/
    ├── allure-report files.js 
│   
└── node_modules/ (auto-generated by npm)


project-folder/: The root directory of your project.

package.json: The configuration file for your Node.js project, specifying project details and dependencies.

package-lock.json: Auto-generated by npm, this file provides a detailed dependency tree with specific package versions.

test/: Directory containing your test scripts.

amazon_search_test.js: A test script file that contains the test scenarios for the Amazon search functionality.

other_test_files.js: Potentially, additional test scripts for other parts of your application or additional test cases.

lib/: Directory for storing utility functions or helper functions used in your test scripts.

webdriver-helpers.js: A file containing utility functions for interacting with Selenium WebDriver and web elements.

allure-results/: A directory where Allure test results are generated.

allure-report/: A directory where Allure report files are stored after generating the report.

node_modules/: A directory auto-generated by npm, containing all the project's dependencies (npm packages). It's where npm stores packages required for your project to function.


Step 5: Write Your Test Script
Create your test script in the test/ directory (e.g., amazon_search_test.js). Use the code provided earlier in this conversation for the test script. You can also add additional test cases as needed.


Step 6: Write Your WebDriver Helper Functions
Create your WebDriver helper functions in the lib/ directory (e.g., webdriver-helpers.js). Use the code provided earlier in this conversation for the helper functions.


Step 7: Configure Scripts in package.json
Update the "scripts" section of your package.json file to include the following scripts: See package.json file


"test": Runs your Mocha tests.

"generate-allure-report": Generates the Allure report.

"open-allure-report": Opens the generated Allure report in the default browser.


Step 8: Run Tests and Generate Reports
To run your tests and generate reports, execute the following commands:


Run tests:
mocha test/amazon_search_test.js


Generate Allure report:
npm run generate-allure-report


Open Allure report in the browser:
npm run open-allure-report

-Headless Selenium Web Browser
-Allure Reports - HTML reports
-Mocha Test Runner
